18/10/22 - Campus

Short but useful meeting to kickoff the project. Defined the scope of the project and key research domains.


**1) Initial Theory!**

- Research outline on QC and QML
	- [[PyQML Book.pdf]]
	- QC resources online - IBM, Google, etc - into [[Quantum Computing Theory]]
	- Other books and videos
- Look into papers on QML fundamentals
	- Better understanding of where quantum has been effectively applied - into [[Quantum ML Theory]]

**2) Fluids/Dynamics applications!**

- Implementations of flow solvers with QC algorithms
- Using QML to solve dynamical systems - simple toy problems
- QML for fluid dynamics!



Summary from Luca Magri

> Your project will be key to the area of quantum computing for classical problems. It is a new area, which has many angles to be explored.
> 
> The first task is for you to do a thorough literature review on quantum machine learning (QML) and quantum computing (QC) for the simulation of fluids. The attention should be given to applications or to dynamical systems that have been tackled with QC or QML, rather than the pure theory behind it. Scopus, web of science, google scholar are good sources of literature review. Read the papers and references therein. Usually abstract and conclusions are the starting points.
> 
> I would like your literature review to end up in a large table, where you collect papers in the left column, and define other columns for the content, notes, applications, complexity, size of the problem, type of QML used, type of QC algorithm used, and any other important feature that you detect and is important.
> 
> These should be two tables: one for QML, one for QC for the simulation of fluids.


The theory is located in [[Quantum Computing Theory]] and [[Quantum ML Theory]]
