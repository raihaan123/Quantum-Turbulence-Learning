30/11/22 - Teams

### Milestones

- Continued categorising applications in QC and QML from literature
	- [[QC Literature Review]]
	- [[QML Literature Review]]

- Attended several Quantum conferences
	- QTML virtually
	- Insights in Technology Conference, Bremen
		- Came across ROLOS by SIT - could be a very useful research tool going forward
		- Xanadu - PennyLane.ai - framework for differential programming with QCs

- Continued with literature review of works mentioned last time
	- Deeper into particularly [[QC for NS in ConDi nozzle.pdf]] and [[QC with VQAs for Burgers Equation.pdf]]
	- For QML techniques, I am a bigger fan of VQAs than QNNs
	- Explored the possibility of using VQAs within SINDy for the sparsity-promoting optimisation step
- 



### Difficulties

- Not knowing exactly how deep to venture into a particular topic before I move on
	- Balance between covering enough research + understanding the mathematics to a suitable degree
- 



### Next Targets

- Define the scope of the FYP!
	- Title - Learning Chaotic Systems with Quantum Reservoir Computing
	- Prospective outcome
	- Type of QML technique to pursue



### Misc Updates
- Only one Autumn-term exam on 19th of January (Aerothermodynamics of Launchers and Re-entry Vehicles)
	- Ideally close out the year with one/two more meetings
		- Narrowing of research themes + working title consolidated
		- Working towards drafting relevant algorithms on paper
		- To reconvine in late January
