### Milestones

- Background reading into QC and QML
	- [[Quantum Computing Theory]]
	- [[Quantum ML Theory]]

- Applications in QC and QML
	- [[QC Literature Review]]
	- [[QML Literature Review]]

- Attending several Quantum conferences!
	- QTML virtually (currently on-going)
	- Insights in Technology Conference, Bremen
	- Main objective is to network with and query the presenters on their opinions on the project



### Difficulties

- Compiled several implemented examples of QC for fluids, but few for QML which is still relatively novel - sourcing research remains slow
	- This could still be an advantage for producing novel research of our own!
- Hard to not get carried away into researching implementation details and extended QC/QML theory - focusing on staying at abstract + conclusion level to increase exploration



### Next Targets

- Complete my fundamental learning
	- Q Amplitude estimation
	- Q Fourier transform - Poisson
	- Parametrised QC's
	- Hamiltonian reframing of dynamics problems
	- Q Annealing for optimisation
	- Q-GANs - lots of reference to this in related literature
	- Variational algorithms - optimisation problems



### Misc Updates (that could be of relevance)
- Spending the week in East Midlands Airport for Airside training
