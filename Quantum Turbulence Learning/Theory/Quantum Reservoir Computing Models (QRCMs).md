#theory 

> A hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithm that combines [[Quantum Computing]] and [[Reservoir Computing Models (RCMs)]] to predict and reconstruct the dynamics of complex systems. It uses a quantum circuit made up of elementary [[Quantum Gates]] to create a highly entangled multi-qubit state, while the optimization of the output map is done using classical methods.
