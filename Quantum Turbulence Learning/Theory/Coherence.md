#theory 

> The ability of a quantum system to remain in a superposition of states. A quantum system is said to be coherent if it can maintain a definite phase relationship between its different states, even when those states are not directly observed. This property is essential for certain types of quantum computations and other quantum phenomena, such as Quantum [[Entanglement]].
> 
> Decoherence is the loss of coherence. It occurs when a quantum system interacts with its environment in a way that causes its quantum states to become mixed or "entangled" with the states of the environment. This process can cause the quantum system to lose its quantum properties and behave more like a classical system, which can make it difficult or impossible to perform certain quantum computations.
