> In this study, the authors use a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithm called [[Quantum Reservoir Computing Models (QRCMs)]] to predict and reconstruct the dynamics of a [[Thermal Convection Flow]]. They investigate the QRCM in two different modes of operation and implement it on an ideal quantum simulator and a real quantum computer. The authors also compare the performance of the QRCM with that of its classical counterpart and demonstrate that the QRCM's performance decreases as the degree of entanglement in the quantum reservoir is reduced. Their work aims to extend the applications of QRCMs to classical nonlinear dynamical systems with a larger number of degrees of freedom.


## Introduction

Starts off by discussing the intersection of [[Quantum Computing]] and ML and how they have the potential to revolutionize data processing. It notes that while quantum computers are still limited in their capabilities and are prone to (De-)[[Coherence]], they have the potential to solve high-dimensional problems more efficiently due to the exponential increase in the data space dimension with the number of [[Qubits]] and the ability of Qubits to represent complex features in data through [[Entanglement]]. It also mentions the use of [[Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)]] and [[Reservoir Computing Models (RCMs)]] for the prediction and reconstruction of the dynamics of chaotic systems, and introduces the concept of hybrid quantum-classical [[Quantum Reservoir Computing Models (QRCMs)]] for predicting and reconstructing the dynamics of a thermal convection flow in the weakly nonlinear regime. The QRCM is composed of a quantum circuit made up of elementary [[Quantum Gates]] that form a highly entangled multi-qubit state, while the optimization of the output map is done using [[Classical Ridge Regression]].

This second part of the introduction describes the main contributions and goals of the study. The first contribution is to demonstrate the feasibility of using a hybrid quantum reservoir computing model (QRCM) to describe the chaotic dynamics of a thermal convection flow on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device. The authors investigate the QRCM in two different modes of operation: a closed-loop scenario in which the QRCM makes a fully autonomous prediction of the temporal dynamics of a Lorenz 63 model with 3 degrees of freedom using an ideal quantum simulator, and an open-loop scenario in which the QRCM reconstructs the temporal dynamics of a Lorenz-type model with 8 degrees of freedom by continually feeding in one or two degrees of freedom and obtaining the remaining degrees of freedom through the QRCM evolution. The open-loop scenario is investigated using an ideal quantum simulator and a real, noisy IBM quantum computer.

The second contribution of the study is to compare the performance of the QRCM with that of its classical counterpart for the same flow. The authors identify hyperparameters in both approaches that can be related to each other, and demonstrate that a systematic reduction of the degree of entanglement in the quantum reservoir by dividing it into blocks of entangled qubits reduces the performance of the QRCM algorithm. They also show that the number of operations of the QRCM circuit can be scaled with O(n) < O(2^n), where n is the number of qubits in the reservoir, for the open-loop scenario.

Finally, the introduction describes the two main frameworks for research on quantum reservoir computing models: the analog framework, which investigates the dynamics of interacting many-particle quantum systems, and the digital gate-based framework, which uses circuits composed of universal quantum gates to build a quantum reservoir on NISQ devices. The authors state that their work falls within the latter framework and aims to extend the applications of QRCMs to classical nonlinear dynamical systems with a larger number of degrees of freedom.
