| [[QC with VQAs for Burgers Equation.pdf]] | This paper discusses the potential applications of variational quantum algorithms in the field of computational fluid dynamics. The authors argue that these algorithms, which are tolerant to noise and require only a few hundred qubits, could be used to solve optimization problems in this field. As an example, they apply the method to Burgers' Equation in one spatial dimension. The authors suggest that quantum computing could have a significant impact in this field if hardware development continues at its current pace. |             |                 |     |     |
| [[QML with PINNs on 1D Poisson.pdf]]      | This paper tries to model PINNs using Quantum Neural Networks. Ultimately proves to not be as accurate as classical PINNs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |             |                 |     |     |
