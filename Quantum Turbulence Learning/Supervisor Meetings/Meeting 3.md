### Milestones

- Continued categorising applications in QC and QML from literature
	- [[QC Literature Review]]
	- [[QML Literature Review]]

- Attended several Quantum conferences
	- QTML virtually
	- Insights in Technology Conference, Bremen
		- Came across ROLOS by SIT - could be a very useful research tool going forward
		- Xanadu - PennyLane.ai - framework for differential programming with QCs

- Continued with literature review of works mentioned last time
	- Deeper into particularly [[QC for NS in ConDi nozzle.pdf]]
- 



### Difficulties

- Ideas were conflicting with my ideas of the applications of classical ML
	- Felt very alien - decided to pause and familiarise myself with the field
	- Difficult to distinguish pure QC and QML methods
- Very few sources include useful results
	- Many are speculative studies
	- Hard to navigate to the useful sources



### Next Targets

- Define the scope of the FYP!
	- Title
	- Prospective outcome
	- Type of QML technique to pursue



### Misc Updates
- Only one Autumn-term exam on 19th of January (Aerothermodynamics of Launchers and Re-entry Vehicles)
	- Ideally close out the year with one/two more meetings 
		- Narrowing of research themes + working title consolidated
		- Working towards drafting relevant algorithms on paper
		- To reconvine in late January
