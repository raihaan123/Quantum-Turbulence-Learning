3/2/23 - In Office

### Milestones

- IBM certified quantum developer!
	- Confident working with Qiskit and IBM Composer / Quantum Lab
	- Confident with vital [[Quantum Computing]] principles (gates, entanglement, coherence, etc)

- Continued work on replicating the work in [[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Reservoir Computing of Thermal Convection Flow]]
	- 


### Difficulties

- Lack of available code... Having to produce from scratch...
- 



### Next Targets

- Complete the replication of results - ideally in ~1/2 weeks

- Set the project interim for after the results have been studied and documented with next steps confirmed

- Study the Kolmogorov flow more closely and mathematically derive a similar L63 formulation for use in the [[Quantum Reservoir Computing Models (QRCMs)]]



### Misc Updates

- 3 taught modules this term!
	- AI, Flow Instability and Transition, Orbital Mechanics
